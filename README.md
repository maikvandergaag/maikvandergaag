### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maik van der Gaag, and work as the CTO for 3fifty, an experienced consultancy company focusing on the Microsoft Cloud. I have over 15 years of experience providing architecture, development, training, and design expertise. During my work, I work on a variety of projects ranging from Cloud Transformations to DevOps implementations.

I love to share my knowledge, which was also one of the reasons why he founded the Dutch Cloud Meetup. Maik is a public speaker who writes blogs and organizes events. Microsoft has recognized me as Microsoft Azure MVP.
